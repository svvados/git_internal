# Homework Assignment: Git Mastery

## Task 1: Repository Basics

- Create a new repository on GitHub.
- Clone the repository to your local machine, create a new file called `README.md`, and commit the changes.
- Push the commits back to the remote repository on GitHub.

## Task 2: Branching and Merging

- Create a new branch called `feature-branch` from the `main` branch.
- Make some changes to an existing file or create a new file, commit the changes, and push the branch to GitHub.
- Then, merge the `feature-branch` into the `main` branch using a pull request.

## Task 3: Resolving Conflicts

- Create a new branch from the `main` branch.
- Make changes to a file in both the `main` branch and your new branch.
- Commit the changes to both branches, causing a conflict.
- Resolve the conflict by manually editing the conflicting file, commit the changes, and push them to GitHub.

## Task 4: Collaboration with Forks
- Fork the `git_internal` repo on GitHub.
- Make changes to `student.txt`: add your first and last name.
- Submit the changes as a pull request to the original repo.
- Add a link to the repo you created in tep 1 to a comment on the PR.
